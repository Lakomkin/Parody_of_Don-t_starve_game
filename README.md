# Parody_of_Don-t_starve_game
Here i'm trying to remake my favorite game on Lazarus IDE 

I used "Spriter" programm to make animations of layout

This school proje—Åt is an experiment of my pascal programming abilities !

I tried to make all kind of blanks for all kind of items in the game. That's why i can always add new objext in the game base on this blanks
